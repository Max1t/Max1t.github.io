## Welcome! 

I am a finnish game dev student. Currently looking for and internship for a game company. I created this website as a small show of my work. 

### Code!

The sidebar on the left has a few games and projects for now. Each have the source code or samples of code i did in the projects.
Most Projects are in C# and Unity but i have some proficieny working with other languages like C++ and Java.
All projects i've been involved in i also did parts of their overall game design.

Always learning and willing to learn more.
