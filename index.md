## Welcome! 

I am a Finnish game Dev student. Currently looking for and internship for a game company. I created this website as a small show of my work. 

### Code!

The sidebar on the left has a few games and projects for now. Each have the source code or samples of code i did in the projects.
Most Projects are in C# and Unity but I have some proficiency working with other languages like C++ and Java.
All projects I've been involved in I also did parts of their overall game design.

Always learning and willing to learn more.
